Rasters are digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps.\n\n![raster data](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/GUID-6754AF39-CDE9-4F9D-8C3A-D59D93059BDD-web.png)\n\n_(Image credit Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.)_\n\nRaster data is thus similar to array data, but specialized to 2D images of the earth.\nRaster data nearly always includes a [Coordinate Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system) that allows one to translate the pixels of the image to specific geographic locations on Earth.\n\nThe most common format for Raster data is the [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) and its recent evolution, the [Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (CoG)](https://www.cogeo.org/).\nIn Python, raster data is commonly read with [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Vectors are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as vertices that define the shape of the spatial object.

For example, Pandas can directly open files from `http[s]://` URLs.\nIf you can find such a link to your dataset, you can pass it directly to Pandas.\nHowever, sometimes it takes some sleuthing to find the right link.\n\nAs an example, let's consider the [NASA Meteorite Landings Database](https://data.nasa.gov/docs/legacy/meteorite_landings/Meteorite_Landings.csv).\n\nClicking the \"export\" button gives us an option to export CSV, which we know pandas can read.\nIf we just click the \"CSV\" button, we download the file to our computer (not what we want).\nInstead, click \"API endpoint\" and select \"CSV\" as Data format.\n\nPasting the results into our code editor gives us the desired URL.\n\n```\nhttps://data.nasa.gov/docs/legacy/meteorite_landings/Meteorite_Landings.csv\n```\n\nWe can feed this directly to Pandas.","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":false}},{"id":"aec72542-b6ff-48cb-93f1-76072e012204","cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nurl = \"https://data.nasa.gov/docs/legacy/meteorite_landings/Meteorite_Landings.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(url)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"       name   id nametype     recclass  mass (g)  fall    year    reclat  \\\n0    Aachen    1    Valid           L5      21.0  Fell  1880.0  50.77500   \n1    Aarhus    2    Valid           H6     720.0  Fell  1951.0  56.18333   \n2      Abee    6    Valid          EH4  107000.0  Fell  1952.0  54.21667   \n3  Acapulco   10    Valid  Acapulcoite    1914.0  Fell  1976.0  16.88333   \n4   Achiras  370    Valid           L6     780.0  Fell  1902.0 -33.16667   \n\n     reclong           GeoLocation  \n0    6.08333     (50.775, 6.08333)  \n1   10.23333  (56.18333, 10.23333)  \n2 -113.00000    (54.21667, -113.0)  \n3  -99.90000     (16.88333, -99.9)  \n4  -64.95000   (-33.16667, -64.95)  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>name</th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>nametype</th>\n      <th>recclass</th>\n      <th>mass (g)</th>\n      <th>fall</th>\n      <th>year</th>\n      <th>reclat</th>\n      <th>reclong</th>\n      <th>GeoLocation</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Aachen</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Valid</td>\n      <td>L5</td>\n      <td>21.0</td>\n      <td>Fell</td>\n      <td>1880.0</td>\n      <td>50.77500</td>\n      <td>6.08333</td>\n      <td>(50.775, 6.08333)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Aarhus</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Valid</td>\n      <td>H6</td>\n      <td>720.0</td>\n      <td>Fell</td>\n      <td>1951.0</td>\n      <td>56.18333</td>\n      <td>10.23333</td>\n      <td>(56.18333, 10.23333)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Abee</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>Valid</td>\n      <td>EH4</td>\n      <td>107000.0</td>\n      <td>Fell</td>\n      <td>1952.0</td>\n      <td>54.21667</td>\n      <td>-113.00000</td>\n      <td>(54.21667, -113.0)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Acapulco</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>Valid</td>\n      <td>Acapulcoite</td>\n      <td>1914.0</td>\n      <td>Fell</td>\n      <td>1976.0</td>\n      <td>16.88333</td>\n      <td>-99.90000</td>\n      <td>(16.88333, -99.9)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Achiras</td>\n      <td>370</td>\n      <td>Valid</td>\n      <td>L6</td>\n      <td>780.0</td>\n      <td>Fell</td>\n      <td>1902.0</td>\n      <td>-33.16667</td>\n      <td>-64.95000</td>\n      <td>(-33.16667, -64.95)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":10},{"id":"8615b361-7d5e-434f-896d-ee2a77d1f532","cell_type":"markdown","source":"This code will work from any computer on the internet! 🎉","metadata":{"trusted":false}},{"id":"c4378b22-dfb8-45d0-8ee5-a7d293822959","cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### OPeNDAP\n\n[OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) - \"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol\" - is a highly established protocol for tranferring NetCDF-style data over HTTP.\nNetCDF and Xarray can open OPeNDAP links directly.\n\nAs an example, we will use a dataset from the [IRI Data Library](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/):\n\n<http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/expert/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.UNIFIED_PRCP/.GAUGE_BASED/.GLOBAL/.v1p0/.Monthly/.RETRO/.rain/>\n\nClicking on the \"Data Files\" tab shows a link to \"OPeNDAP\", which point to the URL <http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/expert/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.UNIFIED_PRCP/.GAUGE_BASED/.GLOBAL/.v1p0/.Monthly/.RETRO/.rain/dods>.

implementations](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#built-in-implementations) including local files, HTTP, FTP, and Zipfile.\nAdditional packages implement the fsspec interface to provide access to cloud storage.\nThese include\n\n- [s3fs](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Amazon S3 and other compatible stores\n- [gcsfs](https://gcsfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for

Local Files\n\nSome programs require data to be on your local hard drive to read.\n\nTo download files to your local computer, we strongly recommend [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/).\n\n`Pooch` is a Python library that can manage data by downloading files from a server (only when needed) and storing them locally in a data cache (a folder on your computer).\n\nHere is an example of using Pooch to download data from the [CRESIS Radar Database](https://data.cresis.ku.edu/).\nAs with the examples above, the first step is to nagivate to web page and try to figure out the actual URL of the files you want to

In-Class Activity: Choosing the Right Data Format\n\n**Goal:**  \nLearn how to choose appropriate data structures and file formats for different types of scientific data.\n\nYou will work **individually**, then in **pairs**, then in **small groups**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Individual Think\n\nYou will be given **one data scenario**.\n\nFor your scenario, write down:\n\n1. What **data structure** fits best?\n   - Tabular data  \n   - Array data  \n\n2. What **file format** would you choose?\n   - CSV  \n   - Parquet  \n   - NetCDF  \n   - HDF5  \n   - Zarr  \n   - (or another format from the lecture)\n\n3. Give **one clear reason** for your choice, using ideas from the lecture  \n   (e.g. file size, performance, metadata, compression, ease of sharing).\n\n> Write your answer down before discussing with anyone.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Pair Discussion\n\nPair up with someone who worked on a **different scenario**.\n\nFor **each scenario**, discuss:\n\n- Why does this data structure make sense?\n- Why is this file format a **good choice**?\n- Why might **another format be a poor choice** for this case?\n\nAs a pair, agree on:\n- The **best** format\n- The **worst** format for that scenario\n\nBe ready to explain your reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Whole-Class Discussion\n\nWe will hear:\n- A few **decision rules** from different groups\n- Examples of **bad format choices** and why they fail\n\nThe instructor will then connect your answers back to:\n- Tabular vs array data\n- Human-readable vs machine-efficient formats\n- Why certain formats are common in Earth and environmental science\n\n---\n\n**Outcome:**  \nBy the end of this activity, you should be able to justify *why* a particular data format is appropriate for a given scientific problem — not just name the formats.","metadata":{}},{"id":"4ef6d974-2d8a-457a-90f6-5af2cdca0ecf","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Scenarios\n\n### Scenario A: Tabular Measurements\nYou have **2 million rows** of atmospheric measurements with columns such as:\n- time  \n- latitude  \n- longitude  \n- temperature  \n- humidity  \n\nThe data will be **queried and filtered frequently** for analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario B: Gridded Climate Data\nYou are working with a **global 3D climate dataset** with dimensions:\n- latitude × longitude × time  \n\nThe dataset will be analysed using **Python** and may be **very large**.\n\n---\n\n### Scenario C: Data Sharing\nYou need to **publish a dataset publicly** so that other researchers can:\n- download it easily  \n- understand what each variable represents  \n- reuse it for their own analysis  \n\nLong-term accessibility and clarity are important","metadata":{}},{"id":"3ad91106-8904-498a-86e4-aaee6f372b26","cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
